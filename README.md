> A secure, cross-platform command-line password manager designed for developers

![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ari1110/pass-cli?label=Version) ![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ari1110/pass-cli?label=Last%20Updated)

Pass-CLI is a fast, secure password and API key manager that stores credentials locally with AES-256-GCM encryption. Built for developers who need quick, script-friendly access to credentials without cloud dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with hardened PBKDF2 key derivation (600,000 iterations)
- **System Keychain Integration**: Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service
- **Password Policy Enforcement**: Complexity requirements for vault and credential passwords
- **Tamper-Evident Audit Logging**: Optional HMAC-signed audit trail for vault operations
- **Health Checks**: Built-in `doctor` command for vault verification and troubleshooting
- **Cross-Platform**: Single binary for Windows, macOS (Intel/ARM), and Linux (amd64/arm64)
- **Script-Friendly**: Clean output modes (`--quiet`, `--field`, `--masked`) for shell integration
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatic tracking of where credentials are used across projects
- **Offline First**: No cloud dependencies, works completely offline
- **Interactive TUI**: Terminal UI for visual credential management

## Quick Start

### Installation

**macOS / Linux (Homebrew)**:
```bash
brew tap ari1110/homebrew-tap
brew install pass-cli
```

**Windows (Scoop)**:
```powershell
scoop bucket add pass-cli https://github.com/ari1110/scoop-bucket
scoop install pass-cli
```

For manual installation and other methods, see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### Getting Started

```bash
# Initialize vault (guided setup on first use)
pass-cli init

# Add your first credential
pass-cli add github
# Enter username and password when prompted

# Retrieve a credential
pass-cli get github

# List all credentials
pass-cli list

# Use in scripts (quiet mode)
export API_KEY=$(pass-cli get myservice --quiet --field password)
```

For detailed usage and examples, see [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Interactive TUI Mode

Pass-CLI includes a Terminal User Interface for visual credential management:

```bash
# Launch TUI mode (no arguments)
pass-cli

# CLI commands work with explicit subcommands
pass-cli list
```

**Key Features**:
- Visual navigation with arrow keys and Tab
- Interactive forms for adding/editing credentials
- Password visibility toggle with `Ctrl+P`
- Search and filter with `/`
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Responsive layout (requires 60x30 minimum terminal size)

Press `?` in TUI mode to see all keyboard shortcuts. For complete TUI documentation and configuration, see [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Core Commands

```bash
# Initialize vault
pass-cli init

# Add credential
pass-cli add github --url https://github.com --notes "Personal account"

# Get credential (formatted display)
pass-cli get github

# Get credential (script-friendly)
pass-cli get github --quiet --field password

# List all credentials
pass-cli list

# Update credential
pass-cli update github --username newuser@example.com

# Delete credential
pass-cli delete github

# Generate password
pass-cli generate --length 32

# Remove vault
pass-cli vault remove

# Health check
pass-cli doctor
```

For complete command reference, flags, and examples, see [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Security

**Encryption**:
- AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation (600,000 iterations)
- Unique salt per vault, unique IV per credential
- Built-in authentication tag prevents tampering

**Password Policy**:
- Minimum 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special symbol requirements
- Enforced for both vault and credential passwords

**Keychain Integration**:
- Master password stored in OS keychain (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- Automatic unlock when needed
- Enable/disable anytime: `pass-cli keychain enable` / `pass-cli keychain disable`
- Check status: `pass-cli keychain status`
- TUI auto-unlocks when keychain is enabled

**Audit Logging** (Optional):
- Tamper-evident HMAC-SHA256 signed audit trail
- Enable with `pass-cli init --enable-audit`

**Vault Location**:
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.pass-cli\vault.enc`
- macOS/Linux: `~/.pass-cli/vault.enc`

## FAQ

### How is this different from `pass` (the standard Unix password manager)?

Pass-CLI offers system keychain integration (no GPG required), built-in clipboard support, usage tracking, cross-platform Windows support, script-friendly output modes (`--quiet`, `--field`, `--masked`), and single binary distribution.

### Is my data stored in the cloud?

No. Pass-CLI stores everything locally on your machine. There are no cloud dependencies or network calls.

### How do I backup my vault?

The vault is a single file. Simply copy it:
```bash
cp ~/.pass-cli/vault.enc ~/backup/vault-$(date +%Y%m%d).enc
```

### What happens if I forget my master password?

Unfortunately, there's no way to recover your vault without the master password. The encryption is designed to be unbreakable. Keep your master password safe.
