# Documentation Conventions

## Style Guide

### Writing Style
- Use second person ("you") for user-facing documentation
- Use active voice for instructions
- Keep sentences concise and clear

### Formatting
- Use sentence case for headings
- Use backticks for inline code: `code`
- Use triple backticks for code blocks with language specified

### Terminology
- Be consistent with technical terms
- Define acronyms on first use
- Use the project's preferred naming conventions

## Structure

### Document Organization
- Start with a clear introduction
- Use hierarchical headings (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Do not include a table of contents - most platforms, including github, provide a native TOC

### Code Examples
- Provide complete, runnable examples
- Include expected output
- Add comments for clarity

## Quality Standards

- All images must have descriptive alt text
- All links must be valid and up-to-date
- All code examples must be tested and working
- Documentation must be kept in sync with code changes
