## Notes and observations:

#### Legend
- [Q] = Question

===

- When running just the command pass-cli, if no vault is identified at the default vault location - instead of attempting to unlock the vault show a message to setup a vault
  - Simlarly on the first detected run of pass-cli, offer to initalize a vault: perhaps we need to expand some instructions on that.

- Add a "pass-cli doctor" command to verify the installation and status of pass-cli is healthy (i.e., the app is up-to-date, a default vault has been found, no config issues, etc.)

- The popular commands (for example: add, get, update, list) should have flags or a second shorter alias for faster command entry. 
  - Also, we should switch -v from verbose to vault

- [Q] If a vault has been removed, and it used keychain to enable it when it was first initialized, are we cleaning up that keychain information
- [Q] Can keychain only be enabled during a vaults initialization? 
- [Q] Should we create a command to inspect and verify the status of the keychain manager on the environment where pass-cli is set-up? 
- [Q] Our 'change-password' command, does this also update the password that's inserted into the keychain?

- [Q] should we employ a bottom to top approach for identifying what vault to work with? similar to Claude's structure:
  - Bottom's up? If vault is not specified, then first look in the project root of where the pass-cli command is being called. If a vault isn't present then look globally (at the default location).
  - Additionally, we can add flags like -g or -gv for global vault and -p or -pv for project vault (if that makes sense and it doesn't conflict with anything).
    - [Q] Maybe -pv and -gv replaces --vault (-v)? Or would it compliment the existing ?

- Parallel to the above should we add structures to check for .pass-cli when present in folders, that way we can also track where other vaults are perhaps around the envrionment, if any? We can introduce the 'pass-cli vaults' command which can list the available vaults on the system (if possible?)

- [Q] How and when are the vault backup files created, is it not part of our standard operational flow? When we originally created vaults it created both the vault.enc file and the vault.enc.backup file.
===

##### Add to config(?)
- Adjust default vault location (?) where to check first instead of the default vault location; need to inspect this further - if this tweak makes sense

##### Documentation

- Noticing the use of January 2025 in some locations, but that doesn't match the actual date of when things were updated.
- Notice the mention of certain paths like config are mentioning locations that don't match what our docs and/or the cli commands and helper text information outputs.
